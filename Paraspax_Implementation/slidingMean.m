% function smean = slidingMean(x,winSize)
%
% Function to calculate mean in a sliding window
%
% Output:
% srms                  - Sliding mean value vector with same size as input
%                         signal. Step size is one sample with mean of 
%                         window according to winSize. Signal gets nan
%                         padded at beginning/end leading.
%
% Input:        
% x                     - Input signal
% winSize               - Window size in samples
%                         Default: 32 samples
